"""
This function returns two Gaussian random numbers with 
mean 0 and standard deviations sigma1, sigma2 using a 
Box-Muller transform.

This was implemented because CUDA.randn has some horrible 
compiler bug, but CUDA.rand seems to be ok. Nonetheless 
this may also give CPU performance benefits with radiation 
because we already need to compute two randn's anyways.
